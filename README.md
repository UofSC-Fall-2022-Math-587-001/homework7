## Homework 6

This week we have a written part and an implementation part. 

### Written part 

Answer the questions found in `main.tex` and turn your answers in by uploading them 
back here before midnight on the due date. You may do this as many times as 
you want. Only your final submission counts.

Remember this is math class so be sure to justify your answers. You will be 
graded on correctness and 

Note: when you submit, your filename must be `solutions.pdf` and it must be a pdf. 

### Implementation part 

This week you will implement the algorithm of the Chinese remainder theorem 
for solving a system of two congruences in Go. You may find it helpful to extend 
this to larger systems. Implementing the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm using this 
and Shanks' algorithm would also help with homework.
